//* ----------------------------------

//* Write a function factorial that takes a non-negative integer num as input and returns its factorial. The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted as n! , is the product of all integers less than or equal to n. The factorial of 0 is defined as 1.

//? Here are some examples of factorial calculations:

//? factorial(0) => 1
//? factorial(1) => 1
//? factorial(2) => 2
//? factorial(3) => 6
//? factorial(4) => 24
//? factorial(5) => 120

//* Your function should work for any non-negative integer input.
const factorial = (num) => {
    let fact = 1;
    for(let i=1;i<=num;i++){
        fact *=i;
    }
    return fact;
}
//? Example usage:
console.log(factorial(5)); //Output : 120
console.log(factorial(0)); //Output : 1
console.log(factorial(3)); //Output : 6
